## **<ins>Introduction</ins>**

## **<ins>Project_Motivation</ins>**



## **<ins>UX</ins>**
Once the concept of the site was developed, as part of the UX design phase I decided to make the site a one page site with distinctive containers for each 
section. The site would have 6 major components,

   - Header
   - Introduction
   - Destinations Information. 
   - Interactive Map
   - Form
   - Footer

Bootstrap was chosen as the main library for the major design elements, it provides the responsiveness required to ensure the site looks good and works well 
across all device sizes. On top of bootstrap, custom CSS was used to provide a unique look and feel and set the site apart. 

**Header**
The header consists of a nav bar, locked to the top of the screen as the page is long the user always has access to the nav bar to jump to the desired 
location. Under that I included a hero image with crisp white text to capture the users attention.

## <ins>Deployment</ins>
The project was developed using GitHub as the repository and I choose to deploy the live project on GitHub Pages,
The live site can be accessed at https://meltaylor78.github.io/holiday_planner/

**Important Note**
The main data for the locations and data that drives the interactive map are contained in the location.js file.
This file drives the menus for the map. Ensure this file remains correctly linked if you deploy the site or make a local copy of the repo.

**To complete the deployment;**
- From the Github repository 
- Navigate to the settings tab on the top of the repository page
- Scroll down to the section GitHub Pages. 
- In this GitHub Pages section, complete the deployment selection;
- Select the Branch to deploy from the first menu
    -	Select the folder from the second menu
    -	Save the settings
Further updates can be made, such as custom domain and enforce HTTPS. I did not opt for a custom domain but did select to enforce HTTPS 
for the additional security it offers. 

GitHub also provides the option to clone the repository, cloning allows you to make a local copy of the repository on your machine. 
You can complete this using the code drop down menu to get details to clone the repositor. You can find more information on how to clone a 
repository on GitHub Docs [Cloning a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
